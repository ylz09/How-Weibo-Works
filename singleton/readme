Problem
----------------------------------------------
In Weibo, there are a lot of daily upgrade.
Some need we modify the logic, which we need finish them following the normal process, 
such as confirm the requirement with the PM, write the code, unit-test, QA-test, back and forth.
When everything is expected, then OP ship the new changes online. Done!

However, there are many cases, we don't need to do all these steps.
For example, you just need change a value of the configuration, like A/B test, the aim id.
Sure, you also affect the online production, but we know it's no problem since we don't change the logic.

Currently, there are so many such configuration values are still hard coded in the code.
To solve this problem, we use singleton to solve it perfectly.
By using singleton, we only need change the configuration files, and all the function use it will be updated.
