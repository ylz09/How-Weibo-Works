Hadoop streaming
----------------------------------------
Hadoop streaming is an programming tool, which allow us to use any programming language you want.
For exmaple, you can use "cat" as mapper and "wc" as reduceer:

	$HADOOP_HOME/bin/hadoop  jar $HADOOP_HOME/contrib/streaming/hadoop-*-streaming.jar \
	-input myInputDirs \
	-output myOutputDir \
	-mapper cat \
	-reducer wc

Let's briefly check how hadoop streaming workd.
1st, both mapper and reducer use STDIN as input and output.
2nd, mapper splits inputs into single line, and tranform it to key/value pairs
		if there's TAB, then KEY \t VALUE
		else KEY \t NULL //the whole line is key, NULL is value
3rd, reducer has the same format

Options of hadoop streaming:
$HADOOP_HOME/bin/hadoop  jar $HADOOP_HOME/contrib/streaming/hadoop-*-streaming.jar \
-input:		path of input 
-output:	path of output
-mapper:	user mapping code
-reducer:	user reducing code
-file:		input files for mapper or reducer
-partitioner:	user defined partition code			
-D:			property assigned by user, e.g.:
				mapred.map.tasks
				mapred.reduce.tasks
				stream.map.input.field.separator
				stream.map.output.field.separator
				stream.reduce.input.field.separator
				stream.reduce.output.field.separator

A word count example:

  g++ -std=c++14 mapper.cpp -o mapper
  g++ -std=c++14 reducer.cpp -o reducer
  cat input | ./mapper | sort | ./reducer 

Result:

cat input | ./mapper | sort | ./reducer
